I had grand plans for this project.  But never really got it to work.  Then I discovered Arduino and ROS.  ROS on Android, and ROS on the Raspberry Pi would both work much better.  Go check out this page: http://code.google.com/p/knex-ros/


This application was meant to be used to use leftover blackberry handhelds as the brains for robots.  It would have sent TouchTones over the headset jack.

See the [Hardware](Hardware.md) page for more information on setting up the hardware.
